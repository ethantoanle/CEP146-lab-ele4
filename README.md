# Exercise 1: Introduction
# This is my introduction
Hello, my name is Ethan. I am a first year student in CPA. I have passion for F&B, especially Asian foods, so I *love traveling around to try delicious foods*. For example:
- Thai Foods
- Korean Foods
- Japanese Foods

# Exercise 2: Create a recipe
# Tteokbokki (Spicy Rice Cakes)
## Ingredients for Tteokbokki (Serves 2)
- 350g / 12 ounces Korean rice cakes, separated
- 150g / 5.3 ounces Korean fish cakes, rinsed over hot water & cut into bite size pieces
- 2 cups Korean soup stock (dried kelp and dried anchovy stock), use this recipe
- 60g / 2 ounces onion, thinly sliced
## Tteokbokki sauce (Mix these in a bowl)
- 3 Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)
## Garnish
- 1 tsp roasted sesame seeds
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 stalk green onion, finely chopped
  
*Notes: 1 Tbsp = 15 ml, 1 Cup = 250 ml*

## How to Make Tteokbokki
1. Soak the rice cakes in warm water for 10 minutes. (If you are using fresh rice cakes that are already tender, feel free to skip this step. However, if you are using packaged rice cakes from the fridge, it is recommended to soak them to enhance their moisture level before proceeding with the recipe.)

2. Boil the soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high heat and dissolve the tteokbokki sauce by stirring it with a spatula. Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes and onion. Boil them a further 3 to 5 mins until the rice cakes are fully cooked.  Then, to thicken the sauce and to deepen the flavor, simmer it over low heat for a further 2 to 4 mins.

3. Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.

**Tips: Leftover tteokbokki can be refrigerated for a day or two. When reheating, add some spare soup stock or water. Though it won’t be as saucy as the first time.**

# Exercise 3: Academic Integrity Policy Document

# Seneca Academic Integrity Policy

## Purpose
To maintain a high standard of academic integrity across the Seneca community and provide the foundation for research, teaching, learning and working practices. 

## Scope
This policy applies to current students and employees.

## Key definitions
### Academic integrity
Within an academic environment, 
> “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.”

From these values flow principles of behaviour that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action to ensure the credentials granted to students accurately reflect their demonstrated knowledge and abilities. 

### Cheating
Obtaining or attempting to get, or aiding another person to obtain, credit for work or improvement in performance evaluation by dishonest or deceptive means. Examples include, but are not limited to, self-plagiarism, impersonation, falsification, taking individual credit for group work, unauthorized collaborations and aids and undeclared AI use.  

### Seneca business day
Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays or any other day Seneca has publicly acknowledged that it is closed.

### Contract cheating
When a student submits academic work created by a third party as if it were their own for academic credit. It may involve a fee paid or an exchange of other items with a third party to complete the work.

### Falsification/fabrication
Misrepresenting another student’s academic work, withholding or forging personal documentation (e.g., medical, academic, and placement information/records, or the unauthorized creation, alteration or reporting of false/inaccurate information in an educational activity) to gain an academic advantage.

### Impersonation
Taking a test, an examination or any other assessment on behalf of another individual in a physical or virtual setting, with their knowledge and consent. 

### Official transcript
A detailed record of a student’s academic history carries an authorized signature and can be requested for a fee.

### Plagiarism
Using another individual’s, group’s or organization’s work (e.g., words, images, ideas, logic, phrases, signatures or computations) as is or modified by replacing words or phrases with synonyms and presenting it as one’s own, without properly citing the source. This may also include self-plagiarism. 

### Self-plagiarism
The unauthorized re-use of one’s work from previous assignments.

### Student record
A documented history of a student’s educational progress found in the Student Centre may include electronic notations/service indicators (e.g., outstanding fees). Electronic notations/service indicators are not visible on a student’s official transcript. 

### Unauthorized aid
Using non-approved supports to complete coursework or assessments, including, but not limited to, peer collaborations, artificial intelligence technology, the internet, smartphones, etc.

### Undeclared AI use
Using artificial intelligence to generate part or all of an assessment without a disclosure statement outlining how and to what extent the artificial technology was used.

### Seneca’s Academic Integrity Program
A holistic, integrated model grounded in teaching and learning that requires the engagement and participation of students and various academic and service areas.

### Academic integrity violation 
An attempt to gain an unfair advantage in any formal assessment, such as coursework and exams.

### Hybrid delivery 
When some parts of a program or course are delivered online, and others are in person and require students to come to campus to complete them.

### Flexible course delivery
When professors teach a class to students in a classroom or lab and broadcast it to other students learning online simultaneously; in courses delivered in a flexible format, students have the choice to come to campus for an on-campus experience or learn remotely online synchronously or asynchronously. 

## Policy
1. General
- Seneca upholds a learning community that values academic integrity, honesty, fairness, trust, respect, responsibility and courage.
- Seneca is committed to delivering high-quality education and teaching excellence while supporting a positive, equitable and inclusive learning environment.
2. Academic integrity program
- Academic integrity is fundamental to ensure the academic credentials granted by Seneca accurately demonstrate the knowledge and learning of students from all backgrounds and experiences.
- The integrated nature of the program requires that policy and procedure, development and training for faculty, along with training sessions and student life programming, be aligned with the institutional philosophies and approaches to academic integrity.
3. Responsibilities
- Seneca is responsible for providing information and resources to students focused on ensuring a clear understanding of academic integrity, its importance, what can be done to avoid violations, and how to receive support to achieve a resolution if they occur.
- Students are responsible for informing faculty of any circumstance affecting their academic performance as soon as it is known to allow enough time for alternate arrangements.
- If a student witnesses or suspects an academic integrity violation, the student can report it following the procedures outlined in Appendix A.
4. Sanctions
- Academic integrity sanctions will be applied according to the severity of the violation committed. (See Appendix B for the academic integrity sanctions.)
- Before final decisions are made and/or sanctions are applied, the student’s record should be consulted to determine if there were aggravating and/or mitigating factors to the academic integrity violation.
- Should a suspected violation of this policy result from, or be combined with, a suspected violation of Seneca’s Student Code of Conduct and/or another non-academic-related Seneca policy, the matter will be investigated and adjudicated through the processes found in the Student Code of Conduct.

## Appendix B: Academic integrity violations – guidelines for sanctions
### Overview
Seneca Polytechnic’s Academic Integrity Program has established sanctions that are imposed according to the nature and extent of the academic integrity offence.

These guidelines for sanctions are not intended to restrict the authority or flexibility of the Academic Integrity Committee in imposing sanctions. The sanctions imposed should reasonably reflect the circumstances, including the severity of the violation, the student’s stage of learning and any other relevant factors (see Factors for Consideration section below).

For the benefit of students, the Academic Integrity Committee shall explain in its written decision the significant reasons the sanctions imposed where deemed warranted. 

### Types of sanctions
Sanctions may include one or more of the following, as determined to be appropriate based on the severity of the offence:

- a verbal or written warning, with opportunities to learn from the experience
required completion of an academic integrity assignment(s) or course(s)
- a make-up assignment or rewriting of an assignment, examination or work
- a lower grade on an assessment (e.g., assignment, examination or course work)  
- a lower grade in the course
- failure in the course
- suspension from Seneca for a minimum of three (3) consecutive terms to a maximum of nine consecutive terms, based on the discretion of the Academic Integrity Committee and approval from the respective dean
- permanent expulsion from Seneca when a student returns to the institution after being suspended under the provisions outlined above and commits a subsequent academic integrity offence
- other penalties as may be appropriate in the circumstances
### Factors for consideration
With each academic integrity violation, the Academic Integrity Committee shall exercise discretion considering the relevant factors. The Academic Integrity Committee may impose a less severe penalty. Conversely, if the matter escalates, the Student Conduct Office can be engaged as required.

Factors to be considered in imposing sanctions or reviewing sanction recommendations include:
- extent of the violation – the actions that constitute specific academic integrity violations vary in severity – some academic integrity offences include minor infractions, while others represent the most extreme violation
- the student’s level of academic experience
- value of the assessment
- extenuating circumstances that may help explain the action taken by the student with due weight being attached to those circumstances
- whether the student admits guilt and accepts responsibility for their action(s)
- prior incidents
### Recording of sanctions
Any academic sanction(s) imposed will be recorded on the student’s account and/or record.  Indicators attached to a student’s account can include:
- Academic Integrity Warning (AIW)
- Academic Integrity Offence (AIO)
- Academic Integrity Suspension (AIS)

**Note:** If the offence is a second (or subsequent) one for the student and/or is in combination with another offence, then a more severe penalty should be considered.
